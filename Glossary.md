# Refactoring #
This is basically the idea of re-forming and/or re-modelling. For example, if you have an old pair of pants and reform it to a skirt, it is called refactoring. You change the architecture of the old stuff or replace existing materials with something else. Another example: the factor of 12 can be 3 and 4, or 2 and 2 and 3. You can use different factoring to get the same number 12.

# Iteration #
means that you build something first, and come back to it later to ameliorate. The thing you build first will not be perfect. You use it and find there are problems or something is lacking , then you can come back to fix the problem and add new stuff. You do this periodically or as needed, and every time the thing will get better.

# tf-idf #
is used to find out which documents are relevant or not relevant for a search term. You search web pages (documents) for a specific term _t_ and you hope the top hits to be relevant.
