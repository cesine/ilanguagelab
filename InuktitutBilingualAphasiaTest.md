# Introduction #

We are currently working on testing Inuktitut on the Android using the [Inuktitut Bilingual Aphasia Test](http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/research/bat/#inuktitut) developed by Dr. Paradis and Lizzie Ningiuruvik in 1993. The Inuktitut Touch Bilingual Aphasia Test project is being led by Diana Olepeka.



# Details #

Our goal is to test the app on a diversity of dialects (Inuktitut and Inuttitut) and age groups to check the feasibility of an Android app for a diversity of Inuktitut speakers. Our hypothesis is that the test will be administrable with 80% of age-matched controls.

Once we have tested the app with controls, we will seek a Speech Language Pathologist who speaks Inuktitut, which we expect to be highly unlikely. Instead we are hoping to find an SLP with experience treating aphasia patients who speak Inuktitut in the Montreal/Ottawa region.

## Methodology ##

  * A native speaker of Inuktitut who is used to working with a patient population will administer the Inuktitut BAT to the participants with the assistance of Olepeka, a member of the Montreal Inuk community.
  * The results will be analyzed using the methodology developed in Cook, Marquis and Achim 2011.
  * The findings, if interesting will be submitted for presentation/publication.


## Timeline ##

  * Software Development November - December
  * Testing December - February
  * Results Analysis January - March
