# Introduction #

Like human language, programming languages are 1 part syntax, 1 part vocabulary, and 1 part culture. Too often when learning a new language we focus on syntax and vocabulary, but not enough on culture/best practices. In this tutorial we "immerse" ourselves in projects to simultaneously learn syntax, vocab and best practices (ie, the classy [hoch-deutsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_German#Terminology) dialect) for getting things done in Android Development.

We have selected a few repositories, 2 which show best practices, and 2 which shows pidgin practices (ie, not fully formed Android development).

# Best Practices #

## MyTracks ##

  * Beginners: Using the GPS
  * Beginners: Choosing the right tool in your toolbox for saving persistent application data
  * Advanced: Using library projects
  * Advanced: good project management ([instructions end to end](http://code.google.com/p/mytracks/wiki/DevelopmentProcess): how others can set up the code and contribute to the project)

## Replica Island ##

  * Beginners: cute flashing button click animations
  * Beginners: Localization
  * Advanced: Game engine
  * Advanced: letting users decide which buttons/touches do what action in your app


# Pidgins & Best Practices Pairs #

## Two page-curl repos ##

  * Don't lock the orientation unnecessarily
  * Do provide booleans so other devs can change arbitrary decisions  (1 page book vs 2 page book, margins vs no margins)

## Two Blogger clients ##

  * Do try to use the ContentProvider, even if its hard to figure out when you are first learning.
